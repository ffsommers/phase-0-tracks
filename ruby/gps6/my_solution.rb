#RELEASE 2
# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# require relative provides method access to the data in state_data.rb file .
#require_relative complements the builtin method require by allowing you to load a file that is relative to the file containing the require_relative statement.
#When you use require to load a file, you are usually accessing functionality that has been properly installed, and made accessible, in your system. require does not offer a good solution for loading files within the projectâ€™s code.
#
#RELEASE 3
#the state_data file is a datastructure using nested hashes with two different syntaxes. the first level is string and rocket notation for storing the name of the state and a nested hash as the value for providing population density and population size using symbol notation.


#For example, if you have unit test classes in the "test" directory, and data for them under the test "test/data" directory, then you might use a line like this in a test case:

require_relative 'state_data'

class VirusPredictor
   # when creating new instance of virusPreductor class the initialize method loads the new instance with some preset data (state of origin , pop density, and population size )
  def initialize(state_of_origin, population_density, population)
    @state = state_of_origin
    @population = population
    @population_density = population_density
  end
   # virus_effects method runs two seperate methods (predicted_deaths and speed_of_spread) and provides provides them the paramaters established in the initialize method which are originally pointing to the state_data file. 
  def virus_effects
    predicted_deaths(@population_density, @population, @state)
    speed_of_spread(@population_density, @state)
  end

  private
     # predicted_deaths methods calculates the number of people who will die in a state based on conditionals evaluating the population desnsity. The calculation itself relies on multiplying the population size by a given percent based on how the population density conditional is evaluated. the Math.floor built-in method rounds down the value calculated.    
  def predicted_deaths(population_density, population, state)
    # predicted deaths is solely based on population density
    if @population_density >= 200
      number_of_deaths = (@population * 0.4).floor
    elsif @population_density >= 150
      number_of_deaths = (@population * 0.3).floor
    elsif @population_density >= 100
      number_of_deaths = (@population * 0.2).floor
    elsif @population_density >= 50
      number_of_deaths = (@population * 0.1).floor
    else
      number_of_deaths = (@population * 0.05).floor
    end

    print "#{@state} will lose #{number_of_deaths} people in this outbreak"

  end
   # speed_of_spread method calculates the speed at which the virus will spread based on the population desnity of a state. Conditional blocks evaluate what factor the virus will spread at based on the population density of a state.  
  def speed_of_spread(population_density, state) #in months
    # We are still perfecting our formula here. The speed is also affected
    # by additional factors we haven't added into this functionality.
    speed = 0.0

    if @population_density >= 200
      speed += 0.5
    elsif @population_density >= 150
      speed += 1
    elsif @population_density >= 100
      speed += 1.5
    elsif @population_density >= 50
      speed += 2
    else
      speed += 2.5
    end

    puts " and will spread across the state in #{speed} months.\n\n"
